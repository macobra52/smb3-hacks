# smb3-hacks

This is a collection of various SMB3 modifications created primarily for use with the randomizer, but can also have uses with various romhacks provided they do not move the respective data locations. All patches here are free to use provided proper credit is given in your respective distributions.

Special thanks to Southbird for his amazing work on the disassembly of SMB3. A lot of the work here would not be possible without it. http://www.sonicepoch.com/sm3mix/
